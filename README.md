# STM32 MCU Custom Bootloader

This repository contains the source code for the **STM32 MCU Custom Bootloader** development project. Visit the "Bootloader" section on my website for more details: [https://kyungjae.com/notes/bootloader/](https://kyungjae.com/notes/bootloader/).



## Introduction

* Developing a custom bootloader for the STM32F407xx MCU family that allows the host to communicate with the
  bootloader over the USART interface and perform MCU‚Äêspeci ic operations through an interactive application
* Used ARM Keil MDK for software development, testing, and debugging



## Development Environment

* Operating system: Windows 11
* Integrated Development Environment (IDE): ARM Keil MDK



## Bootloader-Host Communication over USART Peripheral Interface

### Overview

### Host Application

* The host application runs on a host machine and provides the user with an interactive menu of the available bootloader commands.

>BL_GO_TO_ADDR: When entering the target address to the host application, make sure to account for the T-bit setting. For example, If the address of the user application's reset handler is 0x08008229, then enter 0x08008228. Please see the bootloader source code for more details.

### Host-Bootloader Communication Sequence

* Upon reset, the MCU will go through the initialization process and then will hang at some point (e.g., USART receive function) ready to receive commands from the host.
* Upon receiving a command from the host, the bootloader performs CRC check. It ACKs if the CRC check has succeeded,  NACKs otherwise.
* After ACKing, the bootloader sends its response to the host.

## Bootloader Commands in Detail

* For every bootloader command
  * First byte - **Length to follow**
  * The second byte - **Command code** sent by the host to the bootloader
  * The last four bytes - **CRC** to check the integrity of the bytes received from the host.

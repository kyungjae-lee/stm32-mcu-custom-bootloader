# STM32 MCU Custom Bootloader

This repository contains the source code for the **STM32 MCU Custom Bootloader** development project. Visit the "Bootloader" section on my website for more details: [https://kyungjae.dev/bootloader/](https://kyungjae.dev/bootloader/).



## Introduction

* Developing a custom bootloader for the STM32F407xx MCU family that allows the host to communicate with the
  bootloader over the USART interface and perform MCU‚Äêspeci ic operations through an interactive application
* Used ARM Keil MDK for software development, testing, and debugging
